# Ian's Personal Website

This is an in-progress website to display @igreen1 's portfolio in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.As it stands, this website remains in a beta version. It is a MVP (well, it would be a MVP if I added pictures)

Moving forward, this website has a planned official release date of Summer 2021. 

The final version will begin development in May 2021. This final version will use the lessons learned in the MVP/Beta but will not feature the 'same' codebase (the current codebase will be archived)
